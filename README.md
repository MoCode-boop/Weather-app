# React Weather App

This was my first time creating a project with React. It displays the current weather for Toronto and the current weather description. It shows an outlook for the next 7 days as well. I familiarized myself with 

* JavaScript / TypeScript
* CSS / Tailwind CSS
* HTML
* React Components, React Hooks (useState/useEffect), and Website Structure
* HTML
