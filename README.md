# React Weather App

This was my first time creating a project with React. It displays the current weather for Toronto and the current weather description. It shows an outlook for the next 7 days as well. I familiarized myself with 

* JavaScript / TypeScript
* CSS / Tailwind CSS
* HTML
* React Components, React Hooks (useState/useEffect), and Website Structure
* HTML

To try the website, go to App.tsx and replace any api keys from API fetch calls with your API key from openweathermap.org. 

EX.  fetch('http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=toronto&appid={YOUR API KEY')
## API Reference


In App.tsx, make sure to put in your API key from openweathermap.org.
| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `api_key` | `string` | **Required**. Your API key |
